# Send messages with discord webhooks! Great for making external discord chatbox's
-Enter your webhook URL where it says _"WEBHOOK URL HERE"_ (keep the quotation marks)

# Notes
- Disabled @everyone/@here
- Since this is an old version, if a person types a message that contains @everyone/@here, it will not remove. You may want to fix this.
